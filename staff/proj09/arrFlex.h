/* ArrFlex is a struct which represents a resizable array of characters (not
 * necessarily a string).
 *
 * Originally, it was based off of ArrayList from Java - but we decided to
 * rename it because we're not requiring that students implement a linked
 * list.  We're expecting most implementations to simply be a single large
 * array, which is reallcoated as necessary.

 *    end   >= start
 *    end   <= size
 *
 * ERROR HANDLING: Return NULL if the start or end indices are invalid.
 *                 Also return NULL if there is any error allocating memory.

/* arrFlex_toString()
 *
 * Allocates a new array on the heap, large enough to store the current
 * contents of the array; copies the elements into that array, and returns
 * it.
 *
 * The array that is returned must have one more character than the contents
 * of the ArrFlex object; this last character is set to '\0'.
 *
 * Since the returned array is a duplicate, the caller may modify the array -
 * that will not affect the contents of this object.  Also, the caller is
 * responsible for freeing the array.
 *
 * If the object currently has 0 elements, this will still return a non-NULL
 * pointer; however, the buffer may have as few as 1 bytes in it.
 *
 * ERROR HANDLING: Return NULL if there is any error allocating memory.
 *
 * RETURN VALUE: The new buffer, or NULL.
